# MES Experimental Project

This project uses the MES domain to experiment with various technologies, including Microservices, SpringBoot, Node.JS, Vue, Angular 2, Kafka, Docker.

MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems) sit just above the machines and low level systems in manufacturing environments. They collect data from machines and make use of it to improve performance, reduce waste etc. They may also control the machinery directly.
